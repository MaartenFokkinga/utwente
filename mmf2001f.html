The principal interpretation of an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) consists of individuals, concepts, and properties in the real world; the interpretation is inherently informal and subjective!
Nevertheless, the notation also has an interpretation of its own, in abstract mathematical terms rather than concrete real world terms.
The existence of such an interpretation is important, because it enables us to decide various questions about the notation without resorting to informal (hence subjective) arguments.
<p/>
In this note we give a ``translation'' of an ERD to its formal semantics.
It will turn out that the formal semantics takes a lot more symbols and piece of paper than the ERD itself.
This indicates that ERDs are a concise notation; giving only the mathematical formulas instead of a graphical ERD would be unpractical.
The mathematical semantics comes into play only to give rigorous proofs of theorems about ERDs (such as verifications of <em>checking and manipulations by tools</em>!), or to explain dark corners of the principal interpretation of ERDs.
