Consider a first order typed language, with semantics <i>S</i> for
expressions and types.  Adding subtyping means that a partial order
&lt; on types is defined and that the typing rules are extended to the
effect that expression <i>e</i> has type <i>t</i> whenever <i>e</i> has
type <i>s</i> and <i>s</i>&lt;<i>t</i>.  We show how to adapt the
semantics <i>S</i> in a simple set theoretic way, obtaining a semantics
<i>S'</i> that satisfies, in addition to some obvious requirements,
also the property that: <i>S' s</i> is included in <i>S' t</i>,
whenever <i>s</i>&lt;<i>t</i>.
