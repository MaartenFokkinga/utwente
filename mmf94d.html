We present the category-theoretic notion of adjunction in a way that
makes it easy to formally <i> calculate</i> with it; an acquaintance
with its algebraic properties may greatly help in understanding the
notion.  It is illustrated by means of a lot of theorems and proofs.
We also attempt to provide some intuitive understanding of adjunctions
by various discussions.  Our intended readership is familiar with the
notion of category, functor, and naturality, and either about to learn
about adjunctions or interested in a <i> calculational</i> approach to
category theory.
