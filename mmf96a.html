Constraints in databases may be maintained while transactions are executed, by the automatic invocation of suitable \emph{rules} containing actions that compensate any constraint violation within the transactions.
There is ample opportunity for machine assistence in the construction of the rules.
The correctness and termination of a collection of rules follows from \emph{local} correctness and termination properties for the individual rules, which are left to the responsibility of the user.

This is a summary of the 1990 paper by Ceri and Widom, rephrased on a very abstract level and provided with alternative and simpler proofs.
