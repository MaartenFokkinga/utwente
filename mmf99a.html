      Conventionally, interfaces of objects export a set of messages with
      their types, and suggest nothing about the order in which these services
      may be accessed.  This leaves room for a large number of run-time errors
      or misbehaviours in type correct designs.  To mend this, we introduce
      the notion of  p r o t o c o l , expressing offered and expected
      orderings of messages, along with a notion of protocol correctness.  We
      do this by defining the Protocol Assuring Universal Language Paul, which
      describes protocol aspects of classes, and serves as a basis for formal
      study.
