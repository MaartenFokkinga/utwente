When can a program part be replaced by another?
We discuss this question formally, and in doing so 
we summarise the work of Zwiers et al. (``A Note on Compositional 
Refinement'' and some private communication)
and part of the work of Hoare et al. (``The weakest 
prespecification'' and ``Prespecification in data refinement'').
