We present a formal derivation of program schemes that are usually
called Backtracking programs and Branch-and-Bound programs.  The
derivation consists of a series of transformation steps, specifically
algebraic manipulations, on the initial specification until the desired
programs are obtained.  The well-known notions of linear recursion and
tail recursion are extended, for structures, to elementwise linear
recursion and elementwise tail recursion; and a transformation between
them is derived too.
