Each datatype constructor comes equiped not only with a so-called map
and fold (<i>catamorphism</i>), as is widely known, but, under some
condition, also with a kind of map and fold that are related to an
arbitrary  given monad.

This result follows from the preservation of initiality under lifting
from the category of algebras in a given category to a certain other
category of algebras in the Kleisli category related to the monad.
