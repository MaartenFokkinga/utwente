The concept of <i>dyad</i> is defined as the least common
generalisation of <i>monads</i> and <i>co-monads</i>.  So, taking
some of the ingredients to be the identity, the concept specialises to
the concept of monad, and taking other ingredients to be the identity
it specialises to co-monads.  Except for one axiom, all have a nice
(``natural'') form.
