Self-reference occurs frequently in theoretical investigations  of formal
systems.
In Predicate Logic self-reference is used in G\"odels Incompleteness Theorem:
a <i>formula</i> is constructed that asserts ``I am not formally provable'';
in a programming language self-reference manifests itself in the existence of
a <i>program</i> that writes its own text, a so-called self-reproducing
program.
Also in Nature self-reference plays a role, in the ability of
self-reproduction of the formal system of DNA molecules.
Odifreddi~\cite[page 165--174]{odifreddi89} discusses these topics
and gives good references to the literature.
<p>
In this note we explain, independent of any formalism, how to construct an
expression in a formal system that ``does something with itself''.
As an application of this procedure we show how to construct a program that
writes its own text, lay-out included.
(Our self-reproducing Miranda script is, after some optimisation,
exactly 32 characters long!)
